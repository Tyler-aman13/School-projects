This section includes the final paper and presentation I created for one of my psycholgy research courses.
This course involved both creating and running a survey, analyzing the data and presenting the data to the class.
My survey focused on perceived competency of hypotheical female politicans, and individuals Social Dominance Orientation.
The audience I presented to was not overly statistically savy, but I was able to do work in both SPSS and R to gather data and results.
